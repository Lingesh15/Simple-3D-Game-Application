(IMPROVISED)

**MARCH, 2024**

I am Lingesh from SASTRA University, currently an AR/VR student intern at Roche.This project is

a Unity-based 3D game application, developed using C#. This project is a 3D platformer game

featuring three distinct levels. In this game, the player navigates through various obstacles and

enemies, acquiring weapons to safely progress through portals and ultimately complete the

game.

**Project Overview**

***Game Mechanics and Features***

*Player Movement and Animation:*

● The player can move along the X and Z axes and has the ability to

jump to a speciﬁed height.

● All player movements, including walking, running, jumping, and dying,

are fully animated to enhance the gaming experience.

*Scoring and Collectibles:*

● Players can collect crystals scattered throughout the levels. While

these crystals do not impact gameplay mechanics, they serve as

collectible items to demonstrate the collection functionality within

the game. Points are awarded for each crystal collected.

*Enemies and Interactions:*

2

● Enemies patrol back and forth along the Z axis. Upon collision with

an enemy, the player character dies, triggering a death animation.

● Enemies are also animated for their respective actions and deaths,

adding to the immersive experience.

*Weapons and Combat:*

● Starting from level 2, the player gains access to a sword. This sword

can be ﬁred in the direction the player is facing at a constant speed

to eliminate enemies.

● The sword features its own animations, including visual effects and

an explosion effect upon collision with enemies.

*Turrets:*

● Turrets are strategically placed within the game. These turrets detect

the player within a speciﬁed range and ﬁre arrows when the player

enters their range.

● The turret arrows come with visual effects to enhance the visual

appeal and gameplay challenge.

*Diﬃculty Progression:*

● As the player advances through the levels, the diﬃculty increases,

providing a progressively challenging experience.

*User Interface:*

● The game includes a start screen and an end screen, providing a

clear entry and exit point for players.

**Conclusion:**

This 3D platformer project showcases my skills in game development,

animation, and interactive design using Unity and C#. It combines

engaging gameplay mechanics with visually appealing animations and

effects, offering a comprehensive and enjoyable gaming experience.
