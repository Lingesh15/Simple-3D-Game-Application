# 3D-GAME-APPLICATION: CAPSULE RUNNER

I am Lingesh an AR/VR student intern. This document details the creation of a 3D game application using Unity and the C# programming language. The project demonstrates several key concepts in game development.

## Project Overview

● **GameObject Management**: 
Eﬃciently creating and destroying game objects within the game environment.

● **Transformations:**
Implementing precise position transformations for game objects, along with parent-child transformations for hierarchical movements.

● **Rotations and Animations**: 
Applying rotations to game objects and animating 2D sprites to create dynamic and engaging visuals.

● **User Interface Elements**: 
Utilizing UI components such as different fonts and buttons to enhance user interaction and navigation. The project includes multiple scenes, with distinct start and end screens to guide the player through the game.

***Game Mechanics***

● **Platform Dynamics**: 
The player character adheres to moving platforms, ensuring synchronized movement along the X and Z axes. This mechanic provides a smooth and realistic platforming experience.

● **Player Movement:** 
Players can navigate the game world along the X and Z axes. If the player character falls off a platform, the level automatically restarts, maintaining the challenge.

● **Collision Detection**: 
The game includes hazards in the form of enemy boxes. Colliding with these enemies results in the player's death and a subsequent level restart.

● **Scoring System**:
Players can collect coins scattered throughout the levels, which increments their score, adding a rewarding exploration element.

● **Level Progression**: 
Successfully navigating through level gates advances the player to subsequent levels. Clearing all levels culminates in the game's end screen, providing a sense of achievement and closure.

**Conclusion:**

This Unity project not only showcases fundamental 3D game development skills but also highlights the integration of interactive elements and cohesive game design. The use of Unity and C# allows for a robust and scalable application, capable of providing an engaging user experience.
