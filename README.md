# 3D-GAME-APPLICATION

I am Lingesh, an AR/VR student intern.This project is a Unity-based 3D game application, developed using C#. This project is a 3D platformer game
featuring three distinct levels. In this game, the player navigates through various obstacles and
enemies, acquiring weapons to safely progress through portals and ultimately complete the
game.

## Project Overview

***Game Mechanics and Features***

*Player Movement and Animation:*

  ● The player can move along the X and Z axes and has the ability to jump to a speciﬁed height.
  ● All player movements, including walking, running, jumping, and dying, are fully animated to enhance the gaming experience.

*Scoring and Collectibles:*

  ● Players can collect crystals scattered throughout the levels. While these crystals do not impact gameplay mechanics, they serve as collectible items to demonstrate the collection functionality within the game. Points are awarded for each crystal collected.

*Enemies and Interactions:*

  ● Enemies patrol back and forth along the Z axis. Upon collision with an enemy, the player character dies, triggering a death animation.
  ● Enemies are also animated for their respective actions and deaths, adding to the immersive experience.

*Weapons and Combat:*

  ● Starting from level 2, the player gains access to a sword. This sword can be ﬁred in the direction the player is facing at a constant speed to eliminate enemies.
  ● The sword features its own animations, including visual effects and an explosion effect upon collision with enemies.

*Turrets:*

  ● Turrets are strategically placed within the game. These turrets detect the player within a speciﬁed range and ﬁre arrows when the player enters their range.
  ● The turret arrows come with visual effects to enhance the visual appeal and gameplay challenge.

*Diﬃculty Progression:*

● As the player advances through the levels, the diﬃculty increases, providing a progressively challenging experience.

*User Interface:*

● The game includes a start screen and an end screen, providing a clear entry and exit point for players.
